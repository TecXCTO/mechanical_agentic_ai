 # Mechanical Agentic AI Model

This project aims to develop a comprehensive AI agent capable of automating various aspects of mechanical engineering, including 3D design, simulation, analysis, testing, manufacturing, and production.

## Features

*   **Modular Agent Design:** Easily extendable with new agents for different tasks.
*   **Tool Integration:** Interfaces with common CAD, CAE, and CAM software.
*   **AI-Driven Automation:** Leverages machine learning and AI planning for intelligent task execution.
*   **Configurable Workflow:** Customizable parameters and settings for different projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   [List other prerequisites, e.g., specific CAD/CAE software installed]

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mechanical-agentic-ai

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Your First Agent

This is a quick example to demonstrate running the Design Agent.

1.  **Ensure you have a CAD interface installed and configured.** For this example, we'll assume a mock interface is used if no real one is available.
2.  **Run the generation script:**

    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_cad.py --output_filename my_first_design.stl
    ```

    This will use the Design Agent to create a CAD model based on its configuration.
